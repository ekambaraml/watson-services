*Issue:* After adding a corpora file to the language model, the status of the language model is “stuck” in the “being_processed” state and does not change to “analyzed”
*How to verify the status of the language model:*
curl --insecure -X GET -u “apikey:{api_key}” “https://9.42.134.134:443/speech-to-text/api/v1/customizations/{language_customization_id}/corpora/corpus1”
When broken it looks like:
{
  “out_of_vocabulary_words”: 0,
  “total_words”: 0,
  “name”: “corpus1”,
  “status”: “being_processed”
}

When working it looks like:
{
  “out_of_vocabulary_words”: 3,
  “total_words”: 327,
  “name”: “corpus1”,
  “status”: “analyzed”
}

*Steps to resolve:*
1. Get the STT customization pod name by running: `kubectl get pods`
2. Check the logs: `kubectl logs <name-of-stt-customization-pod>`, if there are db connection exceptions
3. This command will restart the pod: `kubectl delete pod <name-of-stt-customization-pod>`
4. After the pod restarts, the model should automatically process the previously uploaded corpora file and once it is processed, move it to the “analyzed” state
